<div align="center">
<h1>PseudoDB</h1>
<h3>Small scale Object DB</h3>
</div>

It basically writes to files locally, all databases are objects and insertions just set properties on those objects. 
Really similar to localstorage in browser.<br><br>
This is just something I made for a project. Im not sure how fast, reliable or secure it is but its really easy to use..<br>
Also, Im not sure how it reacts to large data sets.. so I dont recommend using it for large scale projects.
